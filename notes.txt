road 225, 291, 308

for the road 
- hue is constant over different lighting conditions, same surface
- saturation is constant over different surfaces with the same lighting


for dark colours (like fresh asphalt) the saturation is high when the lighting is low - the lighting 'washes out' the saturation

for light/reflective colours (like painted reflective yellow lane lines) the saturation is greater under more light (the colours 'pop' more)
